Study Description	There has been resurgence in determining the role of host metabolism in viral infection yet deciphering how the metabolic state of single cells affects viral entry and fusion remains unknown. Here, we have developed a novel assay multiplexing genetically-encoded biosensors with single virus tracking (SVT) to evaluate the influence of global metabolic processes on the success rate of virus entry in single cells. We found that cells with a lower ATP:ADP ratio prior to virus addition were less permissive to virus fusion and infection. These results indicated a relationship between host metabolic state and the likelihood for virus-cell fusion to occur. SVT revealed that HIV-1 virions were arrested at hemifusion in glycolytically-inactive cells. Interestingly, cells acutely treated with glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) become resistant to virus infection and also display less surface membrane cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol in these in glycolytically-inactive cells rescued the virus entry block at hemifusion and enabled completion of HIV-1 fusion. Further investigation with FRET-based membrane tension and membrane order reporters revealed a link between host cell glycolytic activity and host membrane order and tension. Indeed, cells treated with 2-DG possessed lower plasma membrane lipid order and higher tension values, respectively. Our novel imaging approach that combines lifetime imaging (FLIM) and SVT revealed not only changes in plasma membrane tension at the point of viral fusion, but also that HIV is less likely to enter cells at areas of higher membrane tension. We therefore have identified a connection between host cell glycolytic activity and membrane tension that influences HIV-1 fusion in real-time at the single-virus fusion level in live cells.

Comment[IDR Experiment Name]	idr0103-coomer-hiv1fusion/experimentA	

Experiment Sample Type	cell
					
Experiment Description	TZM-bl cells stably expressing CD4 and CCR5 receptors and charged with CCF2, were exposed to HIV-1 pseudoparticles where the Vpr is cloned with BlaM (Vpr-Blam) at MOI = 1. When treating the cells with 100 mM 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG), HIV-1 fusion is blocked. Successive treatment of these cells with 100, 200 and 400 ug/mL of Cholesterol rescues HIV-1 fusion. This experiment shows that cholesterol is key for HIV-1 fusion and that 2DG might downregulate the concentration of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of the host, impeding HIV-1 to effectively fuse in the host.  There are 3 different repeats and in each repeat 6 different experiments (images acquired in different conditions).

Protocol Description	CCF2-loaded TZM-bl cells were excited with a 405nm continuous laser (Leica, Manheim) while recording the emission spectra with a 430-560nm window, pixel by pixel (512 x 512) using a Leica SP8 X-SMD microscope with a lambda resolution of 12 nm. Utilising ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), the ratio of the blue (440-480nm, cleaved CCF2) to green (500-540nm, uncleaved CCF2) emission was calculated pixel by-pixel using 20X objective. Statistical analyses of the BlaM data were performed using a two-tailed Fishers Exact Test (SigmaPlot, San Jose, CA). Cells were then removed of the CCF2 mixture and allowed to incubate for 24 hours in complete DMEM if they were to be analysed for infection by the B-Gal assay (below) for infection.

Here we present all three trials with tiled images corresponding to the whole well (observation chamber) for both channels (C1 blue emission 440-480 nm) and (C2 (500-540 nm) together with he corresponding BlaM ratio images (thresholded c2/c1). We also present the corresponding negative controls for no HIV-1 fusion at all where the HIV-1 Vpr-BlaM pseudoparticles without Env were exposed to TZM-bl cells. These images are ideal to calculated the threshold for no fusion at all in each of the three repeats.

We also provide a ImageJ/FIJI macro to perform the calculations with an automatic threshold, note however that the results presented were produced adjusting the threshold individually for each image according to the control references.	


There are 6 different conditions for all TZM-bl cells exposed to HIV-1 (Vpr-BlaM) pseudoparticles (MOI = 1) with two controls and four different treatments:

1- 100 mM 2DG

2- 100 mM 2DG + 100ug/mL Cholesterol

3- 100 mM SDG + 200 ug?mL Cholesterol 

4- 00 mM SDG + 400 ug?mL Cholesterol 
	

Labeling: The CCF2 FRET probe

Imaging hardware: As described above and the corresponding paper (confocal imaging utilising 405 nm argon light source, 20X and HyD photon bunting detectors)

Feature extraction methods: Use of Image J where the channel C2 is divided by C1. Previous thresholding methods are applied to both channels to eliminate the background.

We have also produced a macro for ImageJ that could be applied when using ImageJ or Fiji:
rename("1.tif");
run("32-bit");
run("Duplicate...", "title=Blue duplicate channels=1");
selectWindow("1.tif");
run("Duplicate...", "title=green duplicate channels=2");
run("Enhance Contrast", "saturated=0.35");
selectWindow("Blue");
selectWindow("green");
setAutoThreshold("Triangle dark");
run("NaN Background");
imageCalculator("Divide create 32-bit", "Blue","green");
selectWindow("Result of Blue");
rename("Ratio");
run("Red/Green");
run("Invert LUT");
run("Edit LUT...");
selectWindow("green");
close();
selectWindow("Blue");
close();
selectWindow("1.tif");
close();

The resulting images, after dividing C2/C1 will present different pixel by pixel values that will oscillate between 0 and 1. The higher the number the bigger effect in CCF2 cleavage, indicating that HIV fusion occurred. One can apply a LUT to obtain a pseudocolor image where green stands for No HIV-1 fusion and Red (lower numbers) for HIV-1 fusion (high numbers). We also provide these images (starting with BlaM).
